What are we building
We are building an extension that will work on top of AI websites such as chatgpt.com Grok.com or Claude.ai 
- Our extension will have a // command which will enable you to call on saved prompts from chat interface of any LLM you are using. A Screen will Pop up and As you //type something it will autocomplete and prompt will populate your Chat interface 
- Our extension will have a @ command which will let you call on save Context from chat interface of LLMS . Screen will pop us and as you write first few word it will auto complete and the save context will populate your Chat Interface 
- Our extension will have save prompt + command. If you type + in the chat interface the prompt that is present in the chat box of LLM will have saved, a UI will popup. it will ask you to name it, you name it, write Description of it and it gets saved in Chrome . Storage 
- Our extension will have an Save context feature, if you select any text on your screen on those website, a brain UI will pop up, if you click on it, a new UI pop us, it asks you to name it and save it.
- Our extension will have a prompt Enhance feature, A button near chat interface of LLM which improves your  prompt. 


Note:
- For storage Chrome . Storage 
- For our persistent storage, a **Hash Map is superior** because most of our critical operations (add, update, delete, get one) are based on a unique ID.
- For our UI and search operations, an **Array is superior** because we need an ordered, Iterable list.
- Our StorageService will act as a smart **Adapter** that stores the data in the most efficient format (a map) but can provide it in the format the rest of the application needs (an array) on demand.





How we want to operate 
- Max use of Dependency Inversion 
- Separation of concerns max
- Composition max
- Max use of Interface First Design 
- **The shape of the problem dictates the shape of the solution. The choice of a data structure is not a matter of preference; it is a direct, logical consequence of the operations you need to perform.** (For Data Structure and Algorithm ask what is the problem, and then what is the most effective way to create data structure and Algorithms)
- Modularity 
- Clear Contracts Clear Boundaries, Clear Abstraction at all scales 
- Maxx SICP Thinking
- Maxx First principles thinking

The Axiomatic Truths of the Victorious End State**

This is the ground truth of the reality we created. This is what "overwhelming victory" looks like, feels like, and is built upon.

#### **Truths of the Product: "The Ghost in the Machine"**

1. **The Aesthetic is High-Agency:** The UI is minimalist, dark, and sleek, evoking the "Lamborghini" ethos. It is unobtrusive, appearing only when summoned, and feels like a powerful, professional upgrade.

2. **The Workflow is Instantaneous:** The // and @ commands are the primary interaction. The command palette appears with zero latency. Interaction is keyboard-first, keeping the user in a state of cognitive flow.

3. **The "Enhance" Button is Magical:** The single, glowing button to improve a prompt is the "wow" feature. It works reliably and delivers a tangibly better prompt with one click.

4. **The Capture is Effortless:** Highlighting any text (user-written or AI-generated) and clicking the "Brain Button" is a seamless, one-second action to save context.

5. **The Dashboard is an Armory:** The popup UI is not a settings menu; it is a clean, beautiful, and searchable library of the user's cognitive assets, logically organized.

6. **The Performance is Flawless:** The extension adds no noticeable overhead to the host page. Animations are fluid. There is no flicker or lag.

7. **The System is Cross-Platform:** The extension works identically and reliably across all major LLM platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).
#### **Truths of the Codebase: "The Glass Engine"**
uths of the Codebase: "The Glass Engine"**

1. **The Architecture is a Pure Blueprint:** The system is a direct implementation of the "Blueprint, Spine, Ribs" model. The contracts are defined in a single, authoritative core/contracts.js file using JSDoc/TypeScript types.
    
2. **The UI is a Decoupled "Brick":** The entire front-end is a swappable module. It communicates with the core logic exclusively through the message-passing contract. One could replace the entire UI framework without the core logic ever knowing.
    
3. **The Storage is a Decoupled "Brick":** The StorageService is a module that perfectly encapsulates chrome.storage. The rest of the system only interacts with its abstract interface (savePrompt, getPrompts).
    
4. **The Logic is Composable:** The core logic (PromptEngine, AI_Client) is a set of pure or near-pure functions. They are composed together to create the application's behavior. The system is provably correct at the component level.
    
5. **The Code is "Cognitively Effective":** The codebase can be understood in 15 minutes. The purpose of every file and the responsibility of every module is self-evident from the structure. There are no "god objects" or tangled dependencies.
    
6. **The Abstraction Barriers are Sacred:** No module ever reaches across its interface to access the internal details of another. The integrity of the black boxes is absolute.
    
7. **The Git History is the True Narrative:** The git log is a clean, linear story of the project's construction, told through atomic, well-documented commits. It is the ultimate source of truth for the system's evolution.
